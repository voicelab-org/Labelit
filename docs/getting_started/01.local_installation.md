# Local Installation

In order to locally install Labelit on your system, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
installed on your system.

Local installation has been tested with **Docker v20.10**

## Steps

* Clone the [repository](https://github.com/voicelab-org/labelit)

**All of the following commands must be run from the root of the labelit folder on your local PC**

* Build and download Docker images:

```bash 
docker compose build
```

* Create running containers and get all logs from all containers

If you have other containers running on your system, they may clash with the new containers.
To avoid conflicts, kill these existing containers with the command: `docker kill $(docker ps -q)`

Now, launching Labelit:

```bash 
docker compose up
```

You will see the output of each container in the same terminal. Do not close the terminal until you are done
as this will shut down labelit.

* You can now access **Django admin** at the address `localhost:8000`
* Labelit itself is accessible at the address `localhost:8081`
* The MinIO console (MinIO is the local object storage service, where local audio files are stored) is accessible
at `localhost:9000`
