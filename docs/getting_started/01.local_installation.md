# Local Installation

In order to locally install Labelit on your system, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system.

Local installation has been tested with **Docker v20.10**

## Steps

* Clone the [repository](https://github.com/voicelab-org/labelit)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:voicelab-org/labelit.git
cd labelit
```

**All of the following commands must be run from the root of the labelit folder on your local PC**

* Build / download docker images:

  * If you plan to develop Labelit, you must build Docker images using:

``` bash 
DOCKERFILE="docker-compose-dev.yaml"
docker compose -f $DOCKERFILE build
```

  * If you only want to test a preview of LabelIt, you can run:

``` bash
DOCKERFILE="docker-compose-preview.yaml"
```

* Create running containers and get all logs from all containers

If you have other containers running on your system, they may clash with the new containers. To avoid conflicts, kill these existing containers with the command: `docker kill $(docker ps -q)`

Now, launching Labelit:

```bash 
docker compose -f $DOCKERFILE up
```

You will see the output of each container in the same terminal. Do not close the terminal until you are done as this will shut down labelit.

* You can now access **Django admin** at the address [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* Labelit itself is accessible at the address [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
* The MinIO console (MinIO is the local object storage service, where local audio files are stored) is accessible at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
