# Helm chart

## Install Chart

_See [configuration](#configuring) below._

_See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for command documentation._

## Uninstall Chart

This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

_See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for command documentation._

```

## Configuring

See [Customizing the Chart Before Installing](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). To see all configurable options with detailed comments, visit the chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/voicelab-org/labelit/blob/develop/helm-chart/values.yaml), or run these configuration commands:

```console
helm show values helm-chart
```

You can create your own `values.yaml` file, then use it to install LabelIt:

```console
$ helm install -f [PATH_TO_VALUES.YAML_FILE] [RELEASE_NAME] helm-chart
```

In addition, LabelIt backend requires some environment variables to run. Refer to [environment variables](03.environment_variables.md).
