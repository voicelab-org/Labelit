# Introduction

Labelit is an extensible web-based annotation tool currently supporting:

* Text and audio annotation (summative)
* Categorical, ordinal classification
* Transcription
* Named entity annotation (highlighting and labeling)
* Text edition (correction, punctuation, etc.)
* Audio region segmentation

The tool comes with utilities for distributing work across multiple annotators,
monitoring progress and (where applicable) annotator agreement, Quality Assurance (QA)
 and managing datasets.

Multiple annotation tasks (e.g. classification + transcription) can be combined
in a single project. (Tasks cannot yet be *nested*, but it's in the roadmap)

Labelit is designed for extensibility: new annotation tasks / schemas
can be created by contributors, while retaining generic features.
