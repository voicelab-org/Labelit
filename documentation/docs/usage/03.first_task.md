# Creating your first task

In Labelit, a `task` is any kind of annotation task. You can create different kinds of tasks (transcription, categorization,
highlighting, etc.) and combine them in a single project, which we'll get to later.

Only *QA users* are permitted to create tasks.

To create a task:

* Login to [labelit](http://localhost:8080/) as a *QA user*
* Navigate to the "Tasks" page
* Click on "Create the task"
* Fill out the form. For some tasks, like categorization, you will be prompted to create the available
labels.
* Confirm

If all went well, the task now appears in the tasks list.
