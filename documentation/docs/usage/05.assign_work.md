# Assign work in batches

In labelit, annotation work is split up into `batches`, which belong to `projects`.

To add a batch

* login to [labelit](localhost:8080) as a *QA user*
* navigate to the "Projects" page
* click on the project you want to assign work in
* click on "Add batch"
* Fill out of the batch creation field

It's important to take note of the following:

* a batch can consume documents from only one dataset, but multiple batches in the same project
can use different datasets
* inside a project, a document can only be included in one batch. 
* you can set the number of annotators per document. Setting this number to 1 means only
one annotator will annotate the document.
* you can configure how the work is distributed among annotators:
    * evenly: annotators must annotate the same number of documents
    * elastically: annotators can annotate as much as they can until the full batch is annotated
