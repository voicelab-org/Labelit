# Update documentation

We use `mkdocs` to maintain our documentation.

### Documentation editing

To edit the documentation, first install the same `mkdocs` version that readthedocs will use during automatic building.

```bash
cd documentation
# Activate your virtual environment
# Or create it using `python -m venv env`
source env/bin/activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

The documentation will be available locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with live reloading as you edit the documentation.

### Documentation building

The build is handled by [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/).

Building must be triggered manually from readthedocs (Projects > Labelit) by clicking the "Build version" button in the overview tab.

You _must_ be added as a maintainer on readthedocs in order to view the project and launch the build and publication.

By default, the latest version of the master branch is used as a starting point for building.
