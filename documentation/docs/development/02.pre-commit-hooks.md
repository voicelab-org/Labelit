# Pre commit hooks

LabelIt uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically **lint** and **format** the codebase. Its configuration is located at the root of the repository. It is used as a step of the CI (continuous integration).

## Installation

While you have clone the repository, you may want install the hooks using the following steps:

- [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) on your system
- Go to the root of the repository `cd labelit`
- Initialize git hooks: `pre-commit install`

## Usage

Every time you'll commit something using git (`git commit -m 'My super commit'`), the hooks will be executed if needed on the staged changes.

You can also manually run hook against all files using:

```bash
$ pre-commit run --all-files
black....................................................................Passed
prettier.................................................................Passed
```
