# Update dependencies

[`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) is used to manage dependencies. A `Makefile` has been create to simplify the process of updating dependencies.

```bash
# Run the backend container
docker compose up backend
# Open a bash session in the backend container
docker compose exec backend bash
# Run pip-compile from the opening bash session
make update
```

These commands will update both `backend/requirements.txt` and `backend/requirements-dev.txt` files.
