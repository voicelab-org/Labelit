# Cloud formation

A cloud formation template has been created to easly create AWS User and AWS S3 buckets for labelit. Use the following command to deploy the stack.

Replace `<CLIENT_NAME>` by the client name in lowercase
Replace `<URL_OF_THE_PLATFORM>` by the URL of the platform. For example: https://new-client.labelit.my-company.com/

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy \
  --template-file deployment/iac/cloud-formation.yaml \
  --stack-name "labelit-<CLIENT_NAME>" \
  --parameter-overrides ClientName=<CLIENT_NAME> URL=<URL_OF_THE_PLATFORM> \
  --capabilities "CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM"
```

To get ACCESS_KEY / SECRET_KEY of the AWS IAM user, explore the `secret manager` service on your AWS console.

Now, you can use theses credentials in your backend configuration (environment variables).
